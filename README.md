# FPGA Lectures for Scientists
This repository is a collection of hands-on FPGA programming examples, for scientists without (or very basic) experience in FPGA programming flow. The intend is to:
* Provide simple functional examples, which incrementally incroporate new FPGA programming concepts. 
* Illustrate digital signal processing of *binary* (1-bit) and *analog* (> 1-bit, using DAC/ADC) data.
* Use open source code, free software tools and low-cost FPGA programming hardware.
