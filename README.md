# FPGA Lectures for Scientists
This repository is a collection of hands-on FPGA programming examples, for scientists without (or very basic) experience in FPGA programming. The intend is to:
* Provide simple functional examples, which incrementally incroporate new FPGA programming concepts. 
* Build custom FPGA designs using *boolean* (1-bit, digital I/O) and *integer* (> 1-bit, DAC/ADC) data types.
* Describe how to control and stream data into (out of) FPGA designs.
* Use open source code, free software tools and low-cost FPGA hardware.
