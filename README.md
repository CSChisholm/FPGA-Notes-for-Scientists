# FPGA Lectures for Scientists
This repository is a collection of hands-on FPGA programming projects, for scientists without (or very basic) experience in FPGA programming. The intend is to provide simple, functional and open-source examples, which incrementally incroporate new FPGA programming concepts. 

Some of the discussed topics are:
* How to use the Xilinx toolchain for FPGA design, simulation and bitstream generation.
* How to use Python (PYNQ) to control and stream data into (out of) a runnig FPGA design.
* Examples on custom FPGA designs using *boolean* (1-bit) and *integer* (> 1-bit) data types, iterfacing digital IOs and ADCs/DACs, respectively. 
* Recurrent applications such as PID controllers, filtering, waveform synthesis...
